    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This quiz contains questions on topics you can expect to see in an interview pertaining to SQL and Relational Databases. Some of them are multiple choice, while some are short answer.

    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "The four main datatpes in SQLite 3 are TEXT, INTEGERS, REAL & BLOB. Yes you can use other common datatypes from other kinds of SQL, such as INT, which would get lumped in as an INTEGER.\n",

    "\n",
    "Aggregate functions are trying to calculate something, whether that is getting an average of a set of values in a table, or counting the number of unique values in a specific column.
